Speed up my repository launch time
==================================

People often ask how they can speed up the launches for their Binder repositories.
Binder is a bit different from other cloud services because it builds and launches
*arbitrary environments* that are defined in Git repositories, rather than only
serving a *single* environment for launches. The extra time it takes
to launch is often a result of these extra steps.

For some background and tips about how you can speed up your repository launch times,
